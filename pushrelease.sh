# Prerequisites:
# - myget_api_key or nuget_api_key is set appropriately
# - The release has been created and built (see tagrelease.sh and
#   buildrelease.sh)
#
# Note that buildrelease.sh doesn't have to have been invoked with
# the same API name and version, so long as the tag is for the same
# commit.

# Sample: pushrelease.sh Google.Pubsub.V1 1.0.0-beta05
